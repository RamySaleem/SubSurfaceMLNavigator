# SubSurfaceMLNavigator
## Geological Inference Through Displacement-Distance Profile Guided by Machine Learning. 

This study creates machine learning (ML) models to predict key features of thrust structures in a coalmine dataset, such as fault length, distance from a reference point, maximum displacement, and displacement-distance profiles.

The data included 110 faults and 930 samples, divided into training, validation, and testing sets. The Random Forest model was best for predicting fault length and maximum displacement, while the Decision Tree model excelled at predicting distance. The Random Forest Classifier was best for classifying displacement-distance profiles.

These models aid in generating displacement-distance plots and subsurface fault conceptual models for better interpretation.

This research presents findings derived from a PhD study conducted within the framework of the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Oil & Gas. Funding for this study was generously provided, with 50% coming from NERC through its National Productivity Investment Fund (grant number NE/R01051X/1) and the remaining 50% granted by the University of Aberdeen via its PhD Scholarship Scheme. We express our sincere gratitude to both organisations for their unwavering support. Our research heavily relies on open-source Python libraries, particularly Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Plotly, and Matplotlib. We extend our appreciation to the developers and contributors of these libraries and to GitHub for their invaluable open-access hosting services, which make our Python scripts accessible to the broader research community.
