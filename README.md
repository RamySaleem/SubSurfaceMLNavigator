## Geological Inference Through Displacement-Distance Profile Guided by Machine Learning. 

This study creates machine learning (ML) models to predict key features of thrust structures in a coalmine dataset, such as fault length, distance from a reference point, maximum displacement, and displacement-distance profiles.

The data included 110 faults and 930 samples, divided into training, validation, and testing sets. The Random Forest model was best for predicting fault length and maximum displacement, while the Decision Tree model excelled at predicting distance. The Random Forest Classifier was best for classifying displacement-distance profiles.

These models aid in generating displacement-distance plots and subsurface fault conceptual models for better interpretation.
